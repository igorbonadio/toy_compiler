# Likely Language

Likely is a language to specify probabilistic models. But it is not just that! In fact Likely is a full language that will help you to build sequence analysis tools.

It is part of a bigger project, [Likely Framework](https://github.com/igorbonadio/likely), that provides the infrastructure to build and run probabilistic models.
