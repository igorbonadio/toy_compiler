# Likely Language

Likely is a language to specify probabilistic models. But not just that! In fact Likely is a full language that will help you to build sequence analysis tools.

It is part of a bigger project, [Likely Framework](https://github.com/igorbonadio/likely), that provides the infrastructure to build and run probabilistic models.

## Quick Start

### Arithmetic Expressions

Likely's arithmetic expressions are very similar to languages like C, C++, Java, Python and Ruby. The only difference is that there isn't operator precedence. So, use parentheses!

```python
1 + 2       # => 3
2 - 1       # => 1
4 / 2       # => 2
2 * 3       # => 6
1 * 2 + 3   # => 5
1 + 2 * 3   # => 9
1 + (2 * 3) # => 7
```

### Boolean Expressions

As arithmetic expressions, there isn't operator precedence in boolean expressions:

```python
1 == 1         # => true
1 != 2         # => true
1 > 2          # => false
1 < 2          # => true
2 >= 2         # => true
2 <= 2         # => true
true and true  # => true
true and false # => false
true or true   # => true
true or false  # => true
not true       # => false
```

### Variable, Symbols & Attributions

You don't need to declare variables in Likely. All you need to do is attribute some value to them.

```python
x = 123
```

There is a special use of variables that are different of other common languages. If you don't attribute a value to a variable, its value is a symbol. Symbols are unique in the world, so if you compare _abc == abc_ it will always be true.

```python
abc == abc # => true, if you didn't attribute a value to abc
abc == bcd # => false, if you didn't attribute a value to abc and bcd
```

### Lists

There are 2 ways to define lists. The fat速 and thin速 way.

Let's start by the fat速 way:

```python
colors = (red, blue, black)
```

And the thin速 way: _under construction_

```python
colors = (
  red
  blue
  black
)
```

## Grammar

```
  program := ( NEWLINE | stmt )*

  stmt := expr NEWLINE

  expr := literal | attr | list | pair | comp_expr | binop | boolop | func_call | constructor_call | prob | '(' expr ')'

  literal := ID | number | STRING | boolean

  number := INTEGER | FLOAT

  boolean := 'true' | 'false'

  attr := ID '=' expr

  list := '(' list_body? ')'

  list_body := expr (',' expr)*

  pair := expr '->' expr

  binop := expr op expr

  op := '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | '==' | '!=' | '>=' | '<=' | '>' | '<' | ':'

  boolop := 'not'? expr ('and' | 'or') expr

  func_call := func list

  func := ID | '(' expr ')'

  constructor_call := func_call ':' fat_expr

  fat_expr := expr (';' expr)

  prob := prob_vars '=' number

  prob_var := joint_vars | cond_vars

  joint_vars := ID (';' ID)*

  cond_vars := joint_vars '|' joint_vars

  comp_expr := if_expr | for_expr | while_expr | func_def

  if_expr := 'if' '(' expr ')' ':' fat_expr 'else' ':' fat_expr

  for_expr := 'for' '(' ID '<-' expr ':' expr ')' ':' fat_expr

  while_expr := 'while' '(' expr ')' ':' fat_expr

  func_def := 'function' '(' func_params? ')' ':' fat_expr

  func_params := ID (',' ID)*
```
